## These functions calculate the inverse of a matrix and then cache it.
## Before calculation of the inverse, it will check the cache to see if
## the inverse has already been computed and just use that value instead.

##  This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and 
## the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x) {
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
